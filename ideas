Ideally things become the focus when they are introduced and then are useful in new ways later
maybe resources could start vague and become more specific (food becomes wheat, meat, milk?)

Click to hunt and randomly get food and wood
use food to survive
use wood to build shelter
shelter produces workers and can be upgraded
use workers to hunt
use lots of food and wood to build a farm (allows for animal husbandry later)
farm produces food and allows farmers
use lots of food and wood to build a forestry (allows for paper later)
use lots of food and wood to build a mine (allows for paper later)

Start with one tab for hunting/scavenging
Add tab for shelter
add tab for farming

change game design

player counts as folk
no clicking for resources?
player must move between jobs to manage early resources until they can get more workers
early struggles are with having enough food to perform other tasks to produce resources for upgrades
once player has basic upgrades, they can stockpile food to do other things
once they can do other things, they can afford shelter and food for other workers, but this is a slow build up

game concept is around locations based around a specific resource
each location has tasks related to gathering and converting that resource
workers can be assigned to each task
upgrades can be purchased in each location to upgrade individual tasks

first location is focused on scavenging food and wood
second location is focused on growing food on a farm, allows shelter in first location
third locaton is focused on gathering stone and iron, allows crafting

Forest
  Resources: food, wood
  Buildings
    Lumbermill (wood, imrpoves lumber jobs and increases base value)
    Trapper (wood, improves hunting job)
    Cabin (wood, produces shelter and folks)
  Jobs
    scavenge(wood + seeds)
    hunt (food)
  Research
    +scavenge
    +hunt

Field
  Resources: seeds, food, livestock
  Buildings:
    Plot (turns seeds into food)
  Jobs
    Farmer (turns seeds into food)
  Research


types of Buildings
  storage
    increases storage for a variety of resources
  production
    allows worker of certain type
    may also increase storage?
  conversion
    allows worker of certain type
    converts one resource to another
