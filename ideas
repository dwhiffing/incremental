Ideally things become the focus when they are introduced and then are useful in new ways later
maybe resources could start vague and become more specific (food becomes wheat, meat, milk?)

Click to hunt and randomly get food and wood
use food to survive
use wood to build shelter
shelter produces workers and can be upgraded
use workers to hunt
use lots of food and wood to build a farm (allows for animal husbandry later)
farm produces food and allows farmers
use lots of food and wood to build a forestry (allows for paper later)
use lots of food and wood to build a mine (allows for paper later)

player counts as folk
no clicking for resources?
player must move between jobs to manage early resources until they can get more workers
early struggles are with having enough food to perform other tasks to produce resources for upgrades
once player has basic upgrades, they can stockpile food to do other things
once they can do other things, they can afford shelter and food for other workers, but this is a slow build up

game concept is around locations based around a specific resource
each location has tasks related to gathering and converting that resource
workers can be assigned to each task
upgrades can be purchased in each location to upgrade individual tasks

first location is focused on scavenging food and wood initially, moves to wood and shelter
second location is focused on growing food on a farm
third locaton is focused on gathering stone and iron
